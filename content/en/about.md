# Me

_A little about myself._

Hi, my name is Jasmeet Salh, and I am a 21 years old university student. This site is my blog, but I'll try to make this about everything else but me. The purpose of this space is be the active record of my activities and thoughts. The start of this blog marks the start of documenting my creative drive through mediums I do not know.

## Purpose

_Why this document exists._
 
 Well I don't know but I'm trying to find out, perhaps you this as a reminder that this life is short we won't be here for long might seize to exists the next second, cherish the moments within. That is precisely the reason I believe having this space is so important, even if I might not have a solidified purpose, constant self reflection upon one's action seems to be the one thing that reminds me of my mortality. Otherwise I'm a lost soul, constantly distracting myself to really address the problem. Hence one of the uses of this blog is for me to document the thoughts from the soul.

## Why Read?

_What someone will get from this._

The simple answer is if you'd like to experience a different way of thinking. I find the best way to improve is this always consider a different perspective(not what people are thinking) a different lens; We humans are radically different or so it seems from the outside but the problem faced by people a thousand years ago are the same as the problem we face today at the core. So I offer to provide a different lens or perhaps just read about something random.
